Loyalties API is not brand agnostic. Each customer attempting to create a new loyalty card is associated with the brand. However this does not restrict the card to the current brand. Possible list of brands are listed below for reference.

britishgas - Brand association with British Gas
sainsbury - Brand association with Sainsbury's Energy

This brand information will be derived from CID. So it is not required to pass this information in the request to create a Loyalty card.
