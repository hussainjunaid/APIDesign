## Group Contracts

## Services-Contracts Collection [/services-contracts]
Services contracts endpoint allows you to create the services contract in SAP. Customer direct debit payment details & marketing consent details provided during the journey would be captured and posted to SAP for creating a contract. After creating a contract, this endpoint will also trigger the confirmation email to customer with the customer & product details captured. Responses from this endpoint will be returned in JSON format only.

>`Note:` Services contracts endpoint will be able to handle only either a bundle product or an individual product at a time.
